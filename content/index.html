            SolarYpsi is a grass-roots effort in Ypsilanti, MI dedicated to the use of
            renewable energy sources and this website demonstrates our efforts in real time
            reporting of electrical production from solar panels. The panels are located
            in and around Ypsilanti and have been funded through a variety of sources.
            Selecting a site on the right will take you to the detail page for that site.
            On the map, a green marker indicates a site that has panels installed and is
            being monitored from this website while an orange marker is for sites that have
            panels installed but no monitoring. Blue markers are proposed or otherwise
            inactive sites.
